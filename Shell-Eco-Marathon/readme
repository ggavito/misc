Two files make up this project, the code that ran our car, the Volts-Wagon. This was run on a Raspberry Pi and a Teensy 3.1. 
Excessive for this project -- in retrospect it probably could have been run on a single microcontroller, but alas we were in too deep when that was realized 
an i2c file for communicating with Arduino and Teensy microcontrollers that ran a motor and its encoder data. a perfect application of
i2c -- spi would have caused way too many wires to be needed and the speed wasn't necessary for this application and a main file for interpreting and displaying all of this info to the driver of the vehicle
using ghetto sensor fusion to put it all together -- encoder for speed when motor is on (most accurate),
GPS for speed when motor is off (less accurate but encoder doesn't work with no power), and BMS for energy usage.

Also includes a dead-man's switch (a magnet built into the driver's glove! If the driver removes their hand from the steering wheel
hall effect sensor, engine power is cut)

Buttons use RPi's GPIO
